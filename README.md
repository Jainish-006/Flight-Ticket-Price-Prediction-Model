 This is a server side demonstration of flight price prediction model. I built a model using sklearn and linear regression using flight price prediction data taken from kaggle.com. Afterwards, I wrote a code in python flask seerver to get http request. Then, the html,css and javascript files created for webpage to ask user to input data.  

#### To install all the dependancies 
python server.py

Then access the demo on "http://localhost:5000"
